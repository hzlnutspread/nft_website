# Welcome to CornHub

This is a website that I have created as practice which showcases my NFTs. Whilst you can stalk what I own, you can also check your own wallets or anyone else's, provided you have their wallet address.

## How to use

1. Enter the wallet address you wish to check against into the `Wallet address` field
2. Enter the collection address of the collection you wish to check for into the `Collection Id` field
3. Press `Search`

I have provided test addresses for you to try out, where you will be able to see all of the Flufworld Seekers that I own.

Once the NFTs have loaded you can click on `Show Stats` to show the metadata associated with that particular NFT.

## Thanks for visiting

Hopefully this is a convenient way for you to check who owns what!
